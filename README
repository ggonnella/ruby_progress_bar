If you have a console based ruby script which takes some time to execute and 
you can calculate which portion of the execution is ready at a certain time, you 
may use this library to give some feedback. 

It will be applied for example to this very simple script:

100.times do 
  sleep 0.1 # let's pretend I'm doing something :)
end

Using ruby_progress_bar it becomes: 

require "progress_bar.rb"
# you must know the number of iterations to initialize the counter
# in this case it's easy, it is 100:
bar = ProgressBar.new(100) # this outputs the scala and opens the bar
100.times do
  sleep 0.1 # let's pretend I'm doing something :)
  bar.next # this will print a dot every 1/50 of the iterations 
end
bar.close # this closes the bar and prints a time benchmark
